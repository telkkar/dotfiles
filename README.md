# dotfiles

My dotfiles. Maybe some miscellaneous crap included. Managed
with [GNU Stow][]. For a good blog post on why to use Stow to manage 
dotfiles, see [this link][invergo].

## How it works

Still working on this part.

See barrucadu's [dotfiles][barrucadu dotfiles] repo. I first learned about
using `stow` from his dotfiles repo.
